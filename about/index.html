<section class="about">
  <p>My name is Jason Dana. I am involved in quite a bit of system administration and application design/development for all sorts of projects. This blog was primarily constructed to supplement my memory by being a widely available resource which I can continuly reference and update. Hopefully this blog can be of some use to anyone else out there that may be involved in similar activites.
